# TI-BASIC
First codes I ever wrote, spanning 1997-2000.

## What is it?
TI BASIC is the Texas Instruments version of BASIC built into the calculator. It is an interpreted language, so it is very slow.
It features modern control flows such as **while** and **for**, but also very poor ones, such as **goto**.

## How to run them 
The codes are binary because they support special characters like "storing variable" arrow etc.
